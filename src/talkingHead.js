//Exercise:

//Add a method to the Song class that returns the string "title is {title} by {artist}.
//Next, create an instance of it with your favorite Talking Heads song and
//use the method you just created to log the title of the song. Then, 
//create another instance of it with your favorite Stevie Wonder song and
//log the title of the song. Export the class using the es6 export method.
